TASK 1 - NUMBER GUESSING GAME
------------------------------

Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on
whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int num, guess, tries = 0;
	srand(time(0)); 
	num = rand() % 100 + 1;
	cout << "Guess My Number Game\n\n";

	do
	{
		cout << "Enter a guess number between 1 and 100 : ";
		cin >> guess;
		tries++;

		if (guess > num)
			cout << "Too high number!\n\n";
		else if (guess < num)
			cout << "Too low number!\n\n";
		else
			cout << "\nCorrect! You got it in " << tries << " guesses!\n";
	} while (guess != num);

	return 0;
}
